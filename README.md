> You’re probably wondering which APIs .NET Standard covers. If you’re familiar with .NET Framework, then you should be familiar with the BCL, which I mentioned earlier. The BCL is the set of fundamental APIs that are independent of UI frameworks and application models. It includes the **primitive types, file I/O, networking, reflection, serialization, XML and more**.

> All .NET stacks implement some version of .NET Standard. The rule of thumb is that when a new version of a .NET implementation is produced, it will usually implement the latest available version of the .NET Standard.

> .NET Standard is a **specification of APIs that all .NET implementations must provide**. It brings consistency to the .NET family and enables you to build libraries you can use from any .NET implementation. **It replaces PCLs for building shared components.**
