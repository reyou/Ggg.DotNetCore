  --no-build                            Skip building the project prior to running. By default, the project will be built.

  --runtime <RUNTIME_IDENTIFIER>        Target runtime to restore packages for.
  --no-dependencies                     Set this flag to ignore project to project references and only restore the root project.
  --force                               Set this flag to force all dependencies to be resolved even if the last restore was successful. This is equivalent to deleting project.assets.json.
