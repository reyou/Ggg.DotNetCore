@*The ViewImports file is a place where we can write code and
    place common directives to pull in namespaces that our views need.
    If there are namespaces that we commonly use in our views, we can have
    using directives appear once in our ViewImports file instead of having
    using directives in every view or typing out the full namespace of a class.*@

@*But if you just wanted to take all the tag helpers that are in this assembly,
    you can just use the asterisk(*). There are many tag helpers available in
    the tag helper library. Let us have a look at the Index view.*@
