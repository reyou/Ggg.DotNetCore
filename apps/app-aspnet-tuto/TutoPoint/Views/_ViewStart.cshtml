@*The Razor view engine in MVC has a convention where it will look
    for any file with the name _ViewStart.cshtml and execute the code inside
    this file. before executing the code inside an individual view.*@
@*The code inside the ViewStart file cannot render into the HTML output of a
        page, but it can be used to remove duplicate code from the code
        blocks inside the individual views.
    In our example, if we want every view to use the Layout view that we have
        created in the last chapter, we could put the code to set the Layout view
        inside a ViewStart instead of having the code inside every view.*@

@{
    Layout = "~/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml";
}
